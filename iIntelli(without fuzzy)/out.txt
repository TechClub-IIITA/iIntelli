 the two-dimensional steady boundary-layer problem for a flat plate in a shear flow of incompressible fluid is considered .
 such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .
 the results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulent flow induced by three-dimensional roughness elements begins when the double row of spiral vortices trailing each element contaminates and breaks down the surrounding field of vorticity, (2) transition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent with increasing roughness height relative to the boundary-layer thickness, (3) after the breakdown of the vorticity field, the strength of the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of the ensuing turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing of roughness elements has little effect upon the initial breakdown (contamination) of the laminar flow, and (5) the trip reynolds number where u and v are the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge of the boundary layer and k is roughness height, such that transition occurs at the roughness position, varies as the position reynolds number to the one-fourth power, viz.
 with air injection, turbulent shear was obtained only for reynolds numbers greater than 2 x 10, this value being in good agreement with earlier results of this investigation .
 a qualitative discussion of these results is given with emphasis on the possibility of a greater stability of the laminar boundary layer in hypersonic flow than at lower speeds .
 comparison with the boundary layer of a uniform flow has also been made to show the effect of vorticity .
 consequently, there exists an inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary layer .
 transverse contamination caused by the turbulent boundary layer on the tunnel sidewall originated far downstream of the flat plate leading edge at reynolds numbers of 1.
 in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the nose or leading edge of the body .
